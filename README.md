```javascript
export const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "your-api-key",
  authDomain: "your-project.firebaseapp.com",
  projectId: "your-project-id",
  storageBucket: "your-project.appspot.com",
  messagingSenderId: "123456789",
  appId: "your-app-id"
};
```

5. Create an admin user in Authentication > Users.
6. Set up Firestore Security Rules (see below).

### 3. Set Up Cloudinary

export const CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME = 'your-cloud-name';
export const CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET = 'your-upload-preset';
```

### 4. Configure WhatsApp and Currency

```javascript
export const WHATSAPP_NUMBER = '1234567890'; // Your WhatsApp number
export const CURRENCY_SYMBOL = 'â‚¦'; // Or '$' for USD
```

### 5. Import Sample Products

1. Install Firebase CLI if not already: `npm install -g firebase-tools`

```

Or manually add them in the Firestore console.

### 6. Firestore Security Rules

Add these rules in Firebase Console > Firestore > Rules:

```
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Allow read access to all users
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read: if true;
    }
    // Allow write access only to authenticated users (admin)
    match /{document=**} {
      allow write: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```
